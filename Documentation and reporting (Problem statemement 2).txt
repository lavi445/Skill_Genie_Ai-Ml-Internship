# AI/ML Internship Project Documentation

This project involves using machine learning to solve different tasks. The goal is to learn about data analysis, model building, and reporting.

## Steps Involved:

1. **Data Understanding:**
   - We looked at the data to understand what it contains.

2. **Data Cleaning:**
   - We fixed any mistakes and made the data easier to work with.

3. **Feature Selection:**
   - We picked out the most important parts of the data to use in our models.

4. **Model Building:**
   - We chose the best machine learning techniques for our tasks and trained them.

5. **Model Testing:**
   - We checked how well our models worked using different measures.

6. **Understanding Results:**
   - We looked at what the models told us and tried to understand why.

7. **Documentation:**
   - We wrote down everything we did so others can understand and use our work.

## Results:

- We successfully built models for different tasks.
- We found some things hard, like dealing with big data.
- We have ideas for making our models even better in the future.
